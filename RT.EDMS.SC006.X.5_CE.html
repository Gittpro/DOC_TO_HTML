	<p>Understanding vocabulary is a great way to increase your comprehension of the material you are reading. Life science uses specific words but also uses words you may have seen or heard in a different context. Review these vocabulary words as they are used in a scientific context. Keep these definitions in your notes so you can reference them when reviewing the lesson material and solving problems.</p>

<p>Knowing the places where mistakes commonly occur is helpful when problem-solving. You can focus on areas you may not have paid attention to, and also predict parts of a problem that may be tricky. Study this list of common misunderstandings related to life science and note if any are familiar.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Plants are not considered living things.</strong> Some people think that plants are not considered living things, and that just animals are. Since plants do not move from place to place, they cannot be alive. This is not the case! Plants are also considered living things. They show the characteristics of being able to reproduce, grow, and take in nutrients. They are made up of cells, just as animals are. They also move in a way. A plant will always bend toward the light.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>All bacteria are bad.</strong> When some people hear the word bacteria, they think of something that causes sickness and even death. However, this is not always the case. Some bacteria actually help the human body by destroying diseases, providing nutrients, and helping the body to digest food. In addition, many bacteria live on your skin and cause no harm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Life science cannot help with the development of society.</strong> Life science actually has many uses in society. Research in life science can help doctors and scientists to understand diseases, human growth, ecosystems, and other applications that will help society thrive over time.</p></li>

	<p>Taking notes as you complete your coursework is a skill that can help you recall and retain information. Once you have your notes, you can use them to study for assessments or revisit topics without having to go through an entire lesson again. It can help you organize the concepts in the lesson. It can help you make connections between terms and concepts. It will also help you practice science skills, like gathering, organizing, and analyzing information.</p>
	<p>How you take notes is up to you, but here are some general note-taking tips:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><p>Write down the lesson title and objectives. This will help you remember the purpose of what you are learning and where you can revisit the information if needed.</p></li>
	<li><p>Write down any key terms, denoted by <strong>bold</strong> text, or other vocabulary words.</p></li>
	<li><p>An outline might help in keeping the information from the lesson organized. You can use the objectives or the section headings to make the sections of your outline.</p></li>
	<li><p>Write down any questions you have as you go through the lesson. If you still have questions at the end of the lesson, seek additional help. This may require you to perform an Internet search on a topic, ask an instructor, or reach out to a friend. Don’t wait when seeking help – don't brush it off as something to figure out later.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p>Now that you have reviewed these note-taking tips, try to go back through the Essential Instruction of the lesson and take notes.</p>
