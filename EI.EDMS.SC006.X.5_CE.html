Odds are you see something that is alive: a pet like a dog, cat, or fish; a wild animal like a bird or a squirrel; a plant like a tree or grass; or even a classmate or sibling. Living things can be classified under life science, and throughout this lesson you will learn all about what life science.</p>

	 <h2>What Is Life Science?</h2>
	 <p><strong>Life science</strong> includes the disciplines that study living things and their environments. Animals, plants, and microorganisms are all living things. Life sciences also includes applied sciences such as food safety, medicine, and agriculture. These are all scientific fields that involve life and its building blocks. For example, food safety scientists study how to avoid contamination by bacteria or other pathogens, keeping food safe to eat. Biology, anatomy, physiology, ecology, genetics, and biochemistry are all branches of life science.</p>
	 <p>Many branches of life science study so much information that they are often studied as subjects on their own. You may study some of these – biology or chemistry, for example – during your school years. This lesson provides an introduction into branches of life science.</p>
	 <p><strong>Biology</strong></p>
	 <p>Biology the study of life, including the structure and function of living things. In a biology course, you might learn about many other things, but they can be classified in other life sciences. Think about yourself. You are a living thing. A biologist would study your form (limbs, torso, brain, organs, internal chemistry, etc.). A biologist would also study your bodily functions. How do you move? How do you get energy? Why do you eat? How do you react to changes in temperature? The list of questions you could ask about how your body works is endless!</p>
	 <p><strong>Ecology</strong></p>
	 <div style="width: 650px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"> <img style="width: 650px; height: auto;" src="EI.EDMS.SC006.X.5_CE/Img2.png" alt="A modern windmill in a bright green field." /><br />The study of ecology can help to develop more sustainable energy sources that have a lower impact on the environment and living things.</div>
	 <p>Ecologists are interested in how different species interact each other and with their environments. The natural environment includes living things as well as nonliving things, including air temperature and pollution. Most ecologists study populations of organisms and their ecosystems. Has a species adapted to live both underwater and on land? Does a species have to live close to another species in order to survive? Where do members of a species live on the planet? Is that species everywhere, or does it require a specific environment in order to survive? These are all questions asked by ecologists.</p>
	 <p><strong>Anatomy</strong></p>
	 <p>Anatomy is the study of the structure of living things, especially their internal structures. Anatomists often cut into specimens to see the inside of them. They use microscopes to learn about the structures of plants and animals. Anatomical researchers have traditionally had to do their work on dead organisms because they had to cut into them to learn about them. Recent advances in imaging technology allow anatomists to learn more about the structures of things while they are still alive.</p>
	  <p><strong>Physiology</strong></p>
	  <p>Physiology studies the vital functions of plants and animals. What are vital functions? They are the processes that keep living organisms alive. Think about yourself. You breathe air and digest food without having to tell your body to do so. Your blood pumps through your veins because your body just takes care of it. You don't have to remember to tell your heart to pump. These are the vital functions of life. Physiologists work to understand these vital functions. For example, a physiologist would study how and why your heart beats.</p>
	  <p><strong>Genetics</strong></p>
	  <p>Genetics is the branch of biology that studies heredity and variation. Every living thing produced by sexual reproduction gets half of their genes from each parent. This makes you, for example, a unique organism – unless you're an identical twin, no one else has the same genetic profile as you. Scientists keep learning more about the importance of different genes for human development and health. This information can lead to better medical care and improve doctors' understanding of human development and disease.</p>

	  <h2>What Are the Other Branches of Life Science?</h2>
	  <p>The following branches of life science are sub-branches of biology. Biology covers a wide range of information, from the study of cell structures to the analysis of ancient fossils. Most biologists choose a specific area of biology to study.</p>
	  <p><strong>Zoology and Botany</strong></p>
	  <p>Zoology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom. Zoology covers multiple components ranging from the structure of organisms all the way to the subcellular unit of life. Botany is the opposite branch. It is the study of the plant kingdom. It explores the structure and processes specific to plants.</p>
	  <p><strong>Evolutionary Biology</strong></p>
	  <p>Evolution is the study of the change in heritable traits of biological populations over generations. The theory of evolution explains that all of the life on Earth shares a common ancestor. Evolutionary biologists use their knowledge to explain the nature of evolutionary change. For example, if a species suddenly developed a new trait, such as dark wings in a moth, they may be able to determine what change in the ecosystem made it beneficial for this species to have dark wings. Adaptation allows some species to survive and thrive, while those that don't adapt well to the environment tend to have smaller populations or even die out. While evolution has long been accepted theory in the scientific community, it is still a hotly debated topic outside of science. For example, about 97&percnt; of scientists accept the theory of evolution, but only 61&percnt; of the general public in the United States agrees with them, according to a poll from the Pew Research Center.</p>

	  <p><strong>Cell Biology</strong></p>
	  <p>Cell biology is the study of cell structure and function. Cell biology studies life as a single cell. These may be cells in a larger organism or a single cell that is an organism. Those single-celled organisms are studied specifically in a branch known as microbiology. Microbiology is the study of all living organisms &ndash; including archaea, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and algae &ndash; that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. What do you think this means?</p>

	<h2>What Makes Life Science Important to Society?</h2>
	<p>Life science has many applications that can benefit society. Research in life sciences can help people to live healthier, longer lives. It can monitor human health and develop new medicines for diseases. Life science can also be used to ensure healthy food and water supplies. Research in ecosystems and plant and animal life can help humans to understand the effects of climate change and to plan for and possibly stop some of its negative effects.</p>
	<p>Each branch of life science may have uses in society. For example, microbiology examines the organisms that cause disease and how the diseases can be treated. Cell biology examines the factors that lead to a cell being unhealthy. Keeping the cells healthy keeps the organs healthy, which keeps the whole body healthy.</p>
	<p>The research done in botany gives farmers a better understanding of how to produce more from their crops. Zoology looks at the effects of an invasive species in an ecosystem. Ecology can show humans the affects that humans themselves have made on different organisms. These are a few examples of the ways that life science can help play an impact to society.</p>
